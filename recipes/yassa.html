    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>For the marinated chicken:</b> In a large bowl or zipper-lock bag, toss together chicken, lemon juice, diced onion, lime juice, oil, 
            Scotch bonnet pepper, and salt until well combined. Cover bowl or seal bag, then marinate in the refrigerator for at least 8 and
             up to 12 hours.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                <b>For the Yassa:</b> Remove chicken from the marinade, scraping off any onions and peppers; discard the marinade. Using paper towels, 
            blot chicken dry. In a Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chicken, skin-side down, and cook until 
            well browned, about 6 minutes. Using a thin metal spatula, turn chicken and cook on second side until browned, about 5 minutes longer. 
            Remove from heat and transfer chicken to a platter.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Lower heat to medium, add onions, and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are softened, about 7 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring and
             scraping frequently, until onions are dark brown and caramelized, about 15 minutes. Stir in garlic and mustard and cook until fragrant and 
             slightly softened, about 1 minute.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Add chicken stock, Scotch bonnet pepper, bay leaf, and chicken along with any accumulated juices, nestling chicken pieces into the onions; season 
                lightly with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat.
            </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>
                Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, gently stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and beginning to 
                fall from the bone, about 1 hour. Season with salt, if needed. Serve with rice, couscous, or fonio, and lemon or lime wedges.
            </p>

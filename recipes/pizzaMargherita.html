    <p>Not only is pizza Margherita the most popular pizza in Italy, but it is also one of the 
        first kinds of pizzas ever made. It gets its name from

    <p>Here is how its made:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg of flour 0</li>
        <li>40 g of brewer's yeast</li>
        <li>600 g of water</li>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

                To obtain an excellent pizza you will have to start from an excellent dough and the key to everything is, in addition to the choice of high quality 
                products, leavening. If you are skilled with sourdough you can use those, but personally I prefer fresh brewer's yeast . It gives the pizza a 
                particular flavor and the leavening is always perfect.

            <p>
                Put the flour and oil in a bowl, preferably a planetary mixer fitted with a spiral hook . Then dissolve the yeast in the warm water and, operating 
                the machine at medium speed, pour slowly. Finally, add the salt. Knead for about 5-10 minutes until the dough comes together.
            </p>
        </li>

            <p>
                Then detach it from the hook, knead it briefly on the floured work surface to give it the shape of a ball and put it to rise in the oven off with the 
                light on until doubled. It will take about a couple of hours.
            </p>
        </li>

            <p>
                After the first leavening, divide the dough into 4 equal parts and roll them out into a circular shape. Cover them with a thin layer of tomato sauce , 
                season with salt and complete with the mozzarella broken up by hand.  
            </p>
        </li>

            <p>
                It is possible to obtain a good cooking of the pizza in the electric oven by simply cooking it for 8 minutes at 230°C on the lowest shelf , 
                then two minutes at the same temperature on the highest one. The cooking times of the pizza in the convection oven, on the other hand, 
                remain unchanged. You just need to lower the oven temperature by 10°C.
            </p>

                When cooked, remove from the oven and decorate with fresh basil .

Recipes HTML project(First project in the TOD Foundations Course, HTML Foundations).
I already had a little bit of experience with HTML so this was a chance for me to practice it.
A new thing I learned with this project is the version control part with git and github.
I had fun practicing git commands and using the terminal since i didn't have much experience with them.
